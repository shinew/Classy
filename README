Have you ever felt that manually checking your courses for time conflicts is too slow, error-prone, and/or tedious? Remember the time when you *just* added a new course, and your schedule falls apart? I sure have.
This software will help UWaterloo students select and optimize course selections. Optimizations include: no time conflicts, highest rated profs first, and taking into account of reserved seatings. Also, multiple schedule generation (in case you're not happy with our first choice!).

===INSTALLATION===
Windows:
1.	Install the latest 2.x Python from http://python.org/download/
2.	Download (at least) the Main folder of this project (See the "Download ZIP" button to the right)
3.	Run the main.py file from the Main folder. This can be done by:
		a) Right-click the file, click "Edit with IDLE", then press F5, or
		b) Navigate to the folder with Command Prompt, type "python main.py (NOTE: this will not work if you don't have python in your path), or
		c) Double-click the file (NOTE: this will not work if you don't have python in your path)
4.	Follow cues to generate schedule(s)

Macs/Linux:
1.	Since Python 2.x is (most likely) preinstalled on your computer, follow steps 2-4 of the Windows Installation for further instructions
